<H1><U>More On World Wide Web</H1></U>
<P>WWW was introduced in 1989 by the English Physicist Sir Tim Berners Lee. The web creators wanted to create a simple way to provide and access different
types of document on the network, without searching through indexes or directories of files or without copying documents from one computer to another
before viewing them. To do so, they established a way to 'link' documents that were stored in different locations on different computers on the network but
under a single frame and thus WWW evolved.</P>

<P>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a service of information in combination of text, photographs, graphics, audio, video, etc. that are presented on the internet.
It allows the multimedia and hypertext files to be displayed and linked on the internet. Before WWW, internet was mainly used in obtaining textual
information. Due to its distinct features, the popularity of WWW is increasing day by day.</P>
