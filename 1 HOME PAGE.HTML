<P>In the recent past, people had been applying different methods of communication, i.e., to transfer information or to share knowledge amongst each other
through postage, telephone, couriers, meeting, news room, training, conference, etc.</P>

<IMG SRC="1.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="30%" HEIGHT="40%" BORDER="3" ALT="INTERNET">


In 2015, the International Telecommunication Unionestimated about 3.2 billion people (3.2×10<SUP>9</SUP> people), or almost half of the world's population, would be online by the end of the year. Of them, about 2 billion would be from developing countries, including 89 million from least developed countries.


<P>But, with the invention of computers extraordinary development has taken place in the field of communication and now sharing of information has become
quicker and easier, irrespective of geographical location of recipients around the globe, there by replacing the traditional media of communications.</P>

<P>All such terms must be making you curious and tempted to explore more about them. These are actually based upon sharing of information among millions of
computer around the globe which is commonly termed as "INTERNET".</P>

<P>Internet is an interconnected Wide Area Network (WAN) of millions of computer that are linked together around the world which share information in the
form of data, graphics, sound, software, text, etc. instantly as and when required.</P>

<P>Internet is also referred to as "Network of Networks". It establishes a high level of connectivity which has resulted into an unparallel degree of
fasted, easiest and the cheapest ways to transfer or share data and information around the globe. It provides access to communication services and
information resources to millions of users around the globe, round the clock.</P>

<H3><U>INTERNET: HISTORY</U></H3>

<P>Internet maps its derivation back to 1969 when it evolved out of an experiment carried by the defence agency of United states. The department of US
Defence was in a process of doing research and technical development in the areas where some of the services of defence (Army, Navy, Air force, Marine corps)
had clear jurisdtion of operation.</P>

<P>This agency i.e., ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), which was later known as DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Project Agency), planned to create a
computer network that would continue to operate even during the emergency or disastrous situations like war.</P>

<P>This had led to the development of ARPANET (Advance Research Projects Agency Network) which worked to link US Scientific and Academic Researchers for
exchanging data and messages between. One computer to another. ARPANET started as a four node network in December 1969.</P>

<P>By 1970's, ARPA helped in the development of a new protocol known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol) for transferring and
tracking of data between the networks so that they can reach the destination end safely.</P>

<P>By 1980's, another federal agency of US named as National Science Foundation (NSF) used ARPANET to connect its five regional supercomputer centers
located at different universities so that their multiple users could share the resources among themselves. Later, NSF created a more sophisticated network
called NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) which was a series of network that was utilized for research and development.</P>

<P>The link between ARPANET, NSFNET and other networks was termed as Internet. (The process of connecting separate networks with each other is called
internetworking. A collection of 'networked networks' is described as being internetworked that is from where the 'Internet' gets its name).</P>

<P>Initially NSFNET was meant only for the purpose of academic research and was not in use for any private organization. As NSFNET did not permit its use
to private organization, several private telecommunication companies built their own network backbones that used the same set of networking protocols as
NSFNET used.</P>

<P>The original ARPANET lost its existence in 1990 and the government discontinue funding to NSFNET in 1995 and the commercial internet services replaced
them. By early 1990s, internet expanded dramatically and the tool which was made for communication in wars found its way into general and commercial use
(i.e., business, home, education, etc.).</P>

<BR><BIG>Protocol:-</BIG>
<BR>A protocol is a convention or standard that regulates the operation and transference of data between two computers. It can be defined as the set of rules
governing the syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication. Protocols may be applied by hardware, software, or a combination of the two.

<P>The primary protocol of internet is TCP/IP protocol which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP is responsible for connection
oriented transmission and IP is responsible for connectionless tansmission that represent logical address of the host machine, example: http// for
accessing HTMI documents, https:// for accessing some 'Secure' HTML documents.</P>

<BR><BIG>Uniform Resource Locator (URL):-</BIG>
<BR>It identifies the location of a website or a web page on the internet. Each web page has a unique address called URL that identifies its location on the
internet. <A HREF="8.html" TITLE="More On URL"><U>Click here for more information.</A></U>

<HR COLOR="RED" SIZE="5">

<BR><BIG>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP):-</BIG>
<BR>It is a protocol that is used to transfer information on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted, transmitted and what action web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. Its main purpose is to provide a way to display and retrieve HTML pages.

<P>It is a request/response protocol between clients and server. The originating client, such as a web browser, web spider or other end-user tools, is
referred to as the user agent.</P>

<P>The server which stores or creates resources such as HTML files and images is called the origin server. In between the user agent and origin server,
there may be several intermediaries, such as proxies, gateways, tunnels, etc. HTTP is called a stateless protocol because it does not keep the previously
executed command in memory.</P>

<H3><U>WORKING OF INTERNET</U></H3>

<IMG SRC="6.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="30%" HEIGHT="40%" BORDER="3" ALT="How Internet Work">

<P>The computers on the Internet are connected to each other through small networks. These networks are connected through the gateways to the Internet backbone.</P>

<P>All computers on the Internet, communicate with one another using TCP/IP, which is a basic protocol (i.e.set of rules) of the Internet. TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) manages thetransmission of data/file/document on the Internet by breaking the data/file/document into small pieces or
parts called packets or datagrams.</P>

<P>Each packet contains actual data and address part, i.e. addresses of destination and source upto 1500 characters. Functioning of TCP and IP are as follows:</P>

<UL TPYE="disc">
	<LI>TCP It breaks message into smaller packets that are transmitted over the Internet and also reassembles these smaller packets into the original 	message that are received from the Internet.
	<LI>IP It handles the address part of each packet, so that the data is sent to the correct address. Each gateway on the network check this address to 	see where to forward the message.

<H3><U>REQUIREMENTS TO ACCESS INTERNET</U></H3>

To get connected to the internet, one needs a computer, communicating media, a connection from an internet service provider and necessary softwares.
<OL TYPE="i" START="1">

	<LI><B>Computer:</B> To get connected to the internet, one can use computer with a considerable speed.</P>

	<LI><B>Modem:</B> The sending and receiving ends of the communication must have a modem. A modem is a computer peripheral device which modulates 		(converts digital signals to analog signals) from the transmitting workstation and demodulates (converts analog signals into digital signals) at the 		recipient's workstation over communication channels. It stands for Modulator Demodulator. Modem can be internal or external. Now a days mobile phones 	also have inbuilt devices which help to access internet through it.</P>

	<LI><B>Communicating Media:</B> All internet signals travel over a communicating media like: telephone wires, radio waves, satellites signals, 			etc.</P>

	<LI><B>Access Right:</B> There are several 'Internet Service Providers' (ISP) that provides accessibility to use internet services from their server. 	Some ISPs are BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited), MTNL (Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited), Reliance, etc. An internet service provider  usually 		supplies communication access rights with a username and password.

<P>To get connected to the internet, the user has to enter his/her user name and password. This ensures and prevents the misuse of internet account by
unauthorized persons. The users take 'access right' and get connected to the internet against certain fee which is paid to ISP.</P>

	<LI><B><A HREF="#Web Browser" LINK="RED">Web Browsers:</A></B> To use internet, a software, i.e. a web browser is needed which helps to setup the 	computer to access internet.</OL>

<H3><U>WAYS TO CONNECT TO INTERNET</U></H3>

Internet connection can be established in different ways:
<UL TYPE="disc">
	<LI><B>Dial-up connection:</B> It is a type of connectivity that uses telephone lines to connect the internet. It was a commonly used connection for 	home PCs to connect to the internet.

<P>In this type of connection, the speed of data transfer is lesser in comparison to broadband and the internet connectivity has to be established each
time whenever a user switched 'ON' the computer.</P>

	<LI><B>Broadband Connection:</B> It is a type of connectivity which connects without disturbing the use of telephone line simultaneously. Broadband 		in telecommunication is a term, which refers to broadband width. It is a signaling method which handles a relatively wide range of data transfer at 	higher speed.</P>

<P>It is faster than dial-up connection. Broadband connection can be established by three media i.e. Cable, DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and Satellite.

<HR COLOR="RED" SIZE="5">

<B><I><U><BIG>NOTE</BIG></U>-Wireless networks that support Internet Connection:

<OL TYPE="i" START="1" >

	<LI>Wi-Fi:</B> It stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is a type of network that supports data communication without the use of wire based media. For 	Wi-Fi to work, the user needs 'Broadband Internet Connection' at base which is connected to wireless router which relays the internet connection that 	is received by the PC with wireless internet card or external wireless adaptor. Such network can establish connection in a range of 100-300 ft.</P>

	<B><LI>WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access):</B> It is a bigger form of connection in comparison to Wi-Fi. It enables to provide 		wireless access up to 50 Km. To establish a WiMAX, a tower called WiMAX Base Station is required. It is similar to a cell phone tower. The internet 		connectivity to an end-user is provided through microwave link between the tower and the user.</P>

	<LI><B>Bluetooth:</B> It is a wireless network connectivity that provides a way to connect and exchange information between devices like: mobile 		phones, laptops, etc., over a secure and private short range network.</P></I>

<P><B><I><U><BIG>NOTE</BIG></U>-An intranet is a private computer network that is maintained by an organization for internal communication. It uses the resources of network (like internet) to share information or operation within its own workstation/department which cannot be accessed by other unauthorized  person. Intranet is also established using internet protocol on net. Intranet provides an efficient way for information among employees at minimum cost, time and effort. Briefly, an intranet can be understand as 'a private version of the Internet', or as a version of the internet confined to an organization.</P>
